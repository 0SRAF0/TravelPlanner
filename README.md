# Travel Planner — AI copilot for group trips

## ⭐ Core Mission

Centralize planning so friend groups decide faster, stay fair on money, and lock an itinerary with zero chaos. 

## 🔧 The Problem We Solve

Group trips melt down across chats, docs, polls, and payments with no single source of truth. 

* **Scattered info**: Links, polls, and budgets live in five apps → **One hub** that tracks decisions and next steps. 
* **Scheduling hell**: Nobody updates calendars → **Auto calendar sync** and smart date picks. 
* **Indecision & overwhelm**: Too many options, vague preferences → **Structured polls** plus summaries that surface consensus. 
* **Budget drama**: Unclear who owes what → **Transparent ledger** with expense allocation. 
* **No clear owner**: Planning stalls → **AI facilitator** that nudges, mediates, and closes loops. 

## 💡 Our Solution

Agentic planner that gathers preferences, proposes balanced options, checks real-time prices, and automates logistics end to end. 

* **AI summaries** of chats and forms to track decisions and tasks
* **Consensus tools**: ranked voting and explainable picks
* **Date picker** powered by calendar availability
* **Real-time pricing** for flights and stays with cached lookups
* **Budget & payments**: cost split, participation tracking, exportable receipts
